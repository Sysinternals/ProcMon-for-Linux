# Process Monitor for Linux (Preview) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/sysinternals/Tools/_apis/build/status/Sysinternals.ProcMon-for-Linux?repoName=Sysinternals%2FProcMon-for-Linux&branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/sysinternals/Tools/_build/latest?definitionId=342&repoName=Sysinternals%2FProcMon-for-Linux&branchName=main)
Process Monitor (Procmon) is a Linux reimagining of the classic Procmon tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows.  Procmon provides a convenient and efficient way for Linux developers to trace the syscall activity on the system.

# Installation & Usage

## Requirements

* OS: Ubuntu 18.04 lts 
* `cmake` >= 3.14 (build-time only)
* `libsqlite3-dev` >= 3.22 (build-time only)

## Install Procmon

Checkout our [install instructions](INSTALL.md) for distribution-specific steps to install Procmon.

## Building Procmon from source

1.  ### Install build dependencies

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get -y install bison build-essential flex git libedit-dev \
      libllvm6.0 llvm-6.0-dev libclang-6.0-dev python zlib1g-dev libelf-dev
    ```

2.  ### Build Procmon

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Procmon-for-Linux
    cd Procmon-for-Linux
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

### Building Procmon Packages 

The distribution packages for Procmon for Linux are constructed utilizing `cpack`.

To build a `deb` package of Procmon on Ubuntu, simply run:

```sh
cd build
cpack ..
```

## Usage

```txt
Usage: procmon [OPTIONS]
   OPTIONS
      -h/--help                Prints this help screen
      -p/--pids                Comma separated list of process IDs to monitor
      -e/--events              Comma separated list of system calls to monitor
      -c/--collect [FILEPATH]  Option to start Procmon in a headless mode
      -f/--file FILEPATH       Open a Procmon trace file
```

### Examples

The following traces all processes and syscalls on the system:

```sh
sudo procmon
```

The following traces processes with process id 10 and 20:

```sh
sudo procmon -p 10,20
```

The following traces process 20 only syscalls read, write and open at:

```sh
sudo procmon -p 20 -e read,write,openat
```

The following traces process 35 and opens Procmon in headless mode to output all captured events to file `procmon.db`:

```sh
sudo procmon -p 35 -c procmon.db
```

The following opens a Procmon `tracefile`, `procmon.db`, within the Procmon TUI:

```sh
sudo procmon -f procmon.db
```
